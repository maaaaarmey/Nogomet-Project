# Nogomet-Project

The Nogomet application allows to visualize all the shots made according to a selection of filters. You can choose the desired comptition, the season, the desired team(s) and the type of shots.
All the shots will be represented on the soccer field on the right of the filtering area. The size variation depends directly on the expected goals (also knows as xG). The xG represent the probability of scoring the goal. You can choose the xG score you want to see on the soccer field with the xG slicer. To illustrate how an xG works let's take two simple examples:
  - the attacker scores with a 25 meter shot in the middle of a forest of opposing defenders. The xG will be very low (close to 0.022 so a probability of scoring of 2.2%) because it is a long shot, with defenders in front of him and a goalkeeper on his line.
  - the attacker scores while he is in the penalty area with an empty goal. Then the xG will be very high (close to 0.96 so a probability of scoring of 96%) because the goal is simple, close to him and without opponents in front of him.
The Nogomet application also allows you to directly save the plot (with all the desired filters) in png or pdf format.
